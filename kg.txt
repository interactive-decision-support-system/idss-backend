[9:28 AM]I also gave the memory/intent management some thoughts
[9:29 AM]Given that we have session ID in the design, we can track intent at 2 levels (big goal vs next move)
1) Session intent = the overall mode for this shopping session
Ask: “What are we trying to do today?”
Common session modes:
Explore: “Show me what’s out there. I’m not ready to choose.”Decide today: “Help me pick one (or a top 1–3) now.”Execute purchase: “I’m ready—help me buy / place the order (maybe with approval).”[9:30 AM]These are just examples and we can have more intents (e.g., finding a good deal for me, returning products, help with tracking an item, etc). We don't have all of these capabilities yet. But, I envisioning how a full system would look like
[9:31 AM]2) Step intent = the next action the user wants right now
Ask: “What do you want me to do next?”
Common step actions:
Research: explain features, check compatibility, summarize reviewsCompare: side-by-side between optionsNegotiate / deal-seek: find discounts, price check, timing adviceSchedule: delivery/install/test drive/appointmentReturn / post-purchase: track shipment, return/exchange, warranty help[9:32 AM]To have a good excetution, we need to track the most important information across a session and next time we meet, we can discuss this further

 Memory/Session/knowledgeGraph/...

 Here are three sources worth taking look at:
https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOShttps://github.com/getzep/zephttps://github.com/openclaw/openclaw(edited)
[9:45 AM]the last link (openclaw) also has some nice implementation of cross channel services which would be something interesting to add as a feature (like whatsapp, ...) (
