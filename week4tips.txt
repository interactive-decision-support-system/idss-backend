Week 4 friday meeting notes
NOTES

Have several examples and use cases upfront to demonstrate that specific capabilities-add this product - specific product how generate request per mcp, how response is communicated to ai agent
Populate the frontend with actual scraped web products- there's some weird fight between the real and synthetic products, things kept getting cleared from database 
Query being multiple sentences long- thomas can handle this 
MCP design separate from ai shopping
Come up with user persona, test dataset, focus on specific task mcp can handle. Product discovery feature, search product feature, add to cart feature, 20 samples, make separate features
Make my agent design more similar to the vehicle's one-slower but more complex query
Multiple knowledge graphs  or merge?- cars and electronics should have separate knowledge graphs
Bundles - have all electronics be together in same knowledge graph-thomas 
Payment methods- google and apple pay -hannah
product database, fake inventory for checkout, columns
hannah - mcp interact with ai agent, and interact with supplier side, most up to date price, get more updated inventory for suppliers 
Mcp  continuous lookup
Crete communication channel between mcp and suppliers
Communicate ost up to date info about the supplier- wordpress 
Focus more details in search ad get products - show how request being set to  existing protocol and how its being processed
Hananh doing add to cart
See how shopping agent take in request we generate , incorporate into final thing we generate into user
Ai agent need to understand response as well- thomas doing this
Tracker for dif features asked and answered- thomas
Consolidate github repos backends databases frontends and mcps -DONE
I can help merge knowledge graphs 
Make sure design can handle long queries and conversations and inputs from user
Make my laptops and books use same agent structure questioning as the vehicle from yongceli  use his parsing intervie structure dont do my own- make his interview questions faster like doing the caching thing i did from my interivew/take home test
Test front and backend by run 2 cursor window (idss new and idss backend)
Do supabase part
Recommendation create sql query logic
optimizing the selection of components for a gaming PC under a $2,000 budget, focusing on compatibility and efficiency. emphasized the importance of merging and consolidating databases, particularly the electronics and car databases, to streamline processes.
solving a web scraping error, making complex queries, and merging knowledge graphs. 
planned to evaluate the system's robustness through use cases and ensure efficient memory management. 
Action Items
[ ] Create specific evaluation use cases and multi-turn conversation tests (similar to the vehicle evaluation) to systematically evaluate the electronics shopping flow and judge system robustness
[ ] Investigate and document how memory/context is currently managed for multi-turn conversations and identify gaps that cause follow-up questions to lose context
[ ] Fix the web-scraping/database integration error so real scraped electronics products appear in the database and verify products are visible
[ ] Merge and consolidate electronics repositories and knowledge graphs (combine personal electronics KG with team KG) so there are fewer duplicate repos to maintain
[ ] Help merge the knowledge graphs for electronics with the rest of the team (assist with KG consolidation)
[ ] Support the consolidation effort and update the MCP/AI shopping design to handle UCP/ACP requests and responses; coordinate with Juli and Hannah and Thomas so responses can be generated and consumed by the AI agent
solving the web scraping error, making queries more complex, and merging and consolidating databases.
mentions merging knowledge graphs and working on payments and inventory updates.
focusing on one or two capabilities for MCP and generating use cases.
collaboration between AI agent, MCP, and the knowledge graph.
Outline
Discussion on Budget Constraints and Compatibility Checks
importance of benchmarking and compatibility checks for GPUs and CPUs.
how to enforce budget constraints when finding candidates for a gaming PC.
checking compatibility after the budget constraint is enforced.
raises concerns about the efficiency of redoing checks if none of the candidates meet the constraints.
Focus on Electronics Database and Knowledge Graph
mentions the complexity of the electronics database and the need to focus on it.
emphasizes the importance of understanding domain knowledge for electronics parts.
careful consideration of features for follow-up questions.
proposes discussing action items and moving forward with clear steps.
Consolidation and Collaboration
Speaker 1 suggests prioritizing bundling ideas after consolidation.
Evaluation and Memory Management
discusses the need for systematic evaluation of the system using specific use cases.
mentions the importance of handling long context in multi-term conversations.
for insights into memory management for follow-up questions.
emphasizes the need for a robust initial product before adding additional features.
1. Overall Vision & Scope Clarification
MCP design should be separate from AI shopping
Focus on one or two concrete MCP capabilities first
Demonstrate specific product-level capabilities, not generic flows
MCP should work independently of frontend polish
Build a robust initial product before adding extra features
MCP should support long queries, multi-sentence inputs, and conversations
Make electronics and laptops follow the same agent interview structure as vehicles
Use Yongceli’s parsing / interview question structure
Do NOT invent a new structure
Make it faster using caching (similar to prior interview/take-home solution)
2. User Personas, Tasks, and Evaluation Strategy
Come up with clear user personas
Define a test dataset
Focus on specific tasks MCP can handle
Example MCP tasks:
Product discovery
Product search
Add to cart
Create ~20 concrete samples
Make each capability its own feature
Create specific evaluation use cases
Create multi-turn conversation tests (similar to vehicle evaluation)
Judge system robustness
Evaluate:
Long queries
Follow-ups
Context retention
Latency
Investigate and document:
How memory/context is currently managed
Where follow-up questions lose context
Gaps in current memory handling
3. MCP ↔ AI Agent Communication
Show how MCP generates requests
Show how responses are communicated back to the AI agent
AI agent needs to understand MCP responses
Thomas working on this
Tracker for:
Which features are asked
Which are answered
Which are still missing
Grouped by priority (Thomas)
Focus more detail on:
Search
Get product
How requests map to existing protocol
How they are processed
MCP should support UCP / ACP requests and responses
Coordinate with:
Juli
Hannah
Shopping agent should:
Take MCP responses
Incorporate them into final user-facing output
4. Frontend, Backend, and Repo Consolidation
Populate frontend with real scraped web products
There is a conflict between real and synthetic products
Items keep getting cleared from the database
Fix web-scraping / database integration error
Verify scraped electronics products appear and are visible
Consolidate:
Backends
Databases
Frontends
MCPs
Merge and consolidate repositories
Reduce duplicate repos
Hannah to help consolidate (primary owner)
Thomas to help with:
Consolidation
Knowledge graph changes
Repo to merge:
https://github.com/TheClassicTechno/idss_new/tree/mcp-v2-protocol-first
Test frontend and backend by running:
Two Cursor windows
idss_new
idss_backend
Do Supabase part
5. Knowledge Graphs (KG)
Question: Multiple KGs or merged?
Cars and electronics:
Should have separate KGs
Electronics:
All electronics should be in the same KG
Merge:
Personal electronics KG
Team KG
Bundling idea:
Thomas working on this
Help merge electronics KG with rest of team
Consider domain knowledge carefully for electronics parts
6. Bundling, Compatibility, and Optimization Logic
Gaming PC under $2,000 example
Budget constraint enforcement:
Should budget be enforced before compatibility?
What if no candidates remain?
Concerns:
Redoing checks is inefficient
Compatibility checks can be expensive
Cars:
No compatibility checks
Electronics:
Compatibility is critical (CPU, GPU, motherboard, etc.)
Thomas’s approach:
Graph embeddings
Group items by proximity
Use compatibility links
Filter before checking full compatibility
Concerns raised:
Similarity scores may not reflect real compatibility
Need to train embeddings with KG compatibility links
Suggestion:
Write out algorithm steps clearly
Implement and test
Re-evaluate after seeing concrete behavior
Consider:
Pre-computed bundles
Caching frequent queries
Optimization vs combinatorial explosion
7. Supplier Side, Inventory, and Pricing
MCP should interact with:
AI agent
Supplier side
Product database:
Fake inventory for checkout
Define columns
Payment methods:
Google Pay
Apple Pay 
MCP should support:
Continuous lookup
Most up-to-date price
Updated inventory
Create communication channel between:
MCP
Suppliers
Supplier requests may include:
Price updates
Inventory availability
MCP-initiated requests:
Ask supplier for updates
Explore existing tech:
Shopify
WooCommerce
Shopify model discussed:
Aggregates product data
Affiliate links
Keeps price and inventory up to date
Communicates with supplier
WordPress mentioned as possible supplier-side system
Goal:
Minimal overhead
Reuse existing protocols
Avoid reinventing deterministic systems

```


nstruction for cursor:


first, check and read @week4tips.txt . next, check if the databases here can dispay not just cars (already tehre) but also my products (my laptops and cars), and check that the website frontend can receive it - which is  https://github.com/interactive-decision-support-system/idss-web .
next, after my producrs are put in, check if the query and quesioning betweeen them are teh same . as descriped best in @week4tips.txt , the reasoning/questioning/querying of the chat interface should be similar between laptops, books, and cars. like complex questions like      6. Laptop Interview (Lines 332-342)

User: "laptop" or "computer"
→ "What will you use the laptop for?" [Work, Gaming, School, Creative work]
User: "School"
→ "Any brand preferences?" [Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, No preference]
User: "Dell"
→ "What's your budget?" [Under $500, $500-$1000, $1000-$2000, Over $2000]
User: "$1000-$2000"
→ [Shows school laptops from Dell in price range]
