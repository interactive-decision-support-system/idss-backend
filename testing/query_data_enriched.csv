How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life? Good battery life and performance, then build quality, and would like 2-in-1 if possible.

I’ve heard performance is good on them unfortunately it isn’t a 2-in-1 but I think it’s the best deal I’ve found so far. From what I’ve seen there are also issues with dissipating heat.
