24,SuggestALaptop,"Great CPU, good battery life and medium-light gaming under 1500-2000 USD LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US: 1500 USD, but can be stretched up to 2000 USD if there is very good value. Purchasing in the US, likely online. Are you open to refurbs/used? Strongly prefer new, but willing to take like-new refurb for good value. How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life? Performance and battery life are my top two priorities. Build quality comes after. Should NOT be a 2-in-1 or have a touch screen. Aesthetically I prefer ultrabooks over gaming laptops, but not if it means sacrificing specs or battery life. Within performance, my topmost priority is a decent CPU for the price range, then at least 16GB RAM (or 32GB if non-upgradable), and then any dedicated GPU from the last 5 years or so will do. I am even willing to go with a strong, newer iGPU if it checks the other boxes below. Storage must be M.2 SSD. I'm okay with 256-512GB as long as it is upgradable to at least 1TB; this is a near-must. If non-upgradable, it should be at least 1TB and have appropriate performance for the price range. For comparison, my current machine rocks a Core i7-8550u (Kaby Lake), GeForce MX150, 256GB mid-range SSD and 4+16GB DDR4 RAM. About due for an upgrade! How important is weight and thinness to you? A reasonable amount of portability is a huge plus. I don't need the cutting edge of ultra-portable, but I would like to frequently carry this laptop in my backpack and use it outside. Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A. Ideally 14-15.6 inches. 16 is also okay. 1440p 60hz is enough for me and very strongly preferred over 1080p. Screen should NOT be OLED; I don't want to even think about burn-in at all. Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. Don't plan to do any CAD or heavy video/photo editing. Don't plan to run big LLMs locally (or any other heavy AI workloads), but I do plan on using it for programming, as well as editing and compiling long LaTeX documents. I want to do some light-moderate gaming, e.g. League of Legends, Slay the Spire, and modded Minecraft. Nothing AAA, and I'm okay with medium settings. I also want to be capable of doing some music production with, e.g. FL Studio, but this is very low prio. If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want? The most demanding would be modded Minecraft. Specifically, I want to be able to run medium-to-heavy modpacks like Nomifactory CEu at ~medium settings, 1440p and consistently above 60fps in mid-to-late-game worlds. The bigger bottleneck here turns out to be running the world rather than rendering it, which is why the CPU is higher prio than the GPU. Very roughly speaking, I want to 2-3x the graphics performance of the MX150, at the very least. Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)? Of these, build quality is the highest prio. A good keyboard/touchpad is nice but not critical. Screen should NOT be touch. Decent ports are a huge plus, e.g. fast USB-C ports, and at least one USB-A port is ideal but not critical. I want to use an external monitor when at home, so Display Port Alt Mode is a must. Headphone jack is very desirable. Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. There is a tricky balance to strike here between battery life and (mostly CPU) performance. I think my yardstick to compare to here is the 14in M5 MacBook Pro. Pretty much the only thing stopping me from pulling the trigger on it is how ungodly expensive it is to get 1TB storage and 32+GB unified memory on it (let alone more cores or the M4 Pro chip). I am wondering how close I can get to that balance within my budget. I am willing to wait a little while for deals, of course.","Looking for a new (refurb OK if like-new) laptop in the US for $1500, stretchable to $2000, prioritizing strong CPU performance and good battery life with reasonable portability.
