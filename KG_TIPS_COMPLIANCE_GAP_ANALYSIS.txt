Comparing our implementation against the research tips for detailed node labels,
properties, relationships, and complexity.
================================================================================

LAPTOPS: WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED vs TIPS

TIP: Manufacturer & Supply Chain - Supplier, Factory, Distributor nodes
OUR STATUS: PARTIAL
- Manufacturer: YES - Laptop MANUFACTURED_BY Manufacturer (country, founded_year, website)
- Supplier: YES - create_supply_chain_relationships() has Manufacturer SOURCES_FROM Supplier
- Factory: YES - Manufacturer OPERATES Factory (location, capacity, established_year)
- Distributor: NO - Not implemented

TIP: Software & Compatibility - Software, OS nodes, COMPATIBLE_WITH, RUNS
OUR STATUS: YES - Methods exist
- create_software_compatibility(): Laptop COMPATIBLE_WITH Software (performance_rating, tested_date)
- Laptop RUNS OperatingSystem (name, version, architecture)
- Software node: name, category, version, developer, license_type

TIP: Reviews & Sentiment - Review, Sentiment nodes, User WROTE_REVIEW
OUR STATUS: YES - All implemented
- User WROTE_REVIEW Review
- Review REVIEWS Product
- Review HAS_SENTIMENT Sentiment (label)
- Review properties: rating, comment, sentiment_score, sentiment_label, helpful_count, verified_purchase

TIP: Comparison Relationships - SIMILAR_TO, BETTER_THAN, CHEAPER_THAN
OUR STATUS: YES - Method exists
- create_comparison_relationships(product_id1, product_id2, comparison_type, score)
- Supports: SIMILAR_TO, BETTER_THAN, CHEAPER_THAN, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOKS: WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED vs TIPS
-----------------------------------

TIP: Detailed Authorship - Author node with nationality, biography, awards
OUR STATUS: YES - All implemented
- Author node: name, nationality, birth_year, biography, awards
- Book WRITTEN_BY Author

TIP: Genres & Themes - Genre, Theme nodes, multiple genres/themes
OUR STATUS: YES
- Genre: BELONGS_TO_GENRE (primary genre), SUBGENRE_OF for hierarchy
- Theme: Book EXPLORES_THEME Theme (multiple themes supported)
- Genre: name, description

TIP: Publication Details - Publisher node, PUBLISHED_BY with year
OUR STATUS: YES
- Publisher: name, country, founded_year, website
- Book PUBLISHED_BY Publisher (year on relationship)

TIP: Literary Connections - INSPIRED_BY, SIMILAR_THEME, SEQUEL_TO
OUR STATUS: YES - Method exists
- create_literary_connections(book_id1, book_id2, connection_type, description)
- Supports: INSPIRED_BY, SEQUEL_TO, SIMILAR_THEME, etc.

TIP: User Interactions & Recommendations - RECOMMENDED_WITH, etc.
OUR STATUS: YES - Methods exist
- create_user_interactions(): User VIEWED/PURCHASED/ADDED_TO_WISHLIST Product
- RECOMMENDED_WITH relationship (Book to Book)
- RECOMMENDED_WITH in kg.txt schema

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL TECHNIQUES: WHAT WE IMPLEMENTED vs TIPS
-----------------------------------------------

TIP: Add More Properties - Rich property sets on nodes
OUR STATUS: YES - Extensive
- 50+ property keys in kg.txt (base_clock_ghz, boost_clock_ghz, capacity_gb, sentiment_score, etc.)
- Laptop: weight_kg, portability_score, battery_life_hours, screen_size_inches
- CPU: cores, threads, tdp_watts, generation, tier
- GPU: vram_gb, ray_tracing, memory_type
- Author: nationality, birth_year, biography, awards
- Review: sentiment_score, sentiment_label, helpful_count, verified_purchase

TIP: Utilize Hierarchies - Genre SUBGENRE_OF parent
OUR STATUS: YES
- create_genre_hierarchy(): Genre SUBGENRE_OF parent Genre
- e.g. 'Science Fiction' SUBGENRE_OF 'Fiction'

TIP: Entity Resolution - Merge duplicate entities
OUR STATUS: NO - Not implemented
- No post-processing Cypher or graph data science for duplicate merge
- Could add: identify same author with different spellings, merge Manufacturer duplicates

TIP: Use Tools for Ingestion - Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder
OUR STATUS: PARTIAL
- We have build_knowledge_graph.py, build_knowledge_graph_all.py (scripted ingestion)
- No automatic LLM extraction from unstructured text (product descriptions, reviews)
- Could add: LLM extracts entities/relationships from descriptions -> generate graph

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: IMPLEMENTED vs GAPS
-----------------------------

IMPLEMENTED (aligned with tips):
- Laptop: CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, Display as separate nodes with detailed properties
- Manufacturer, Supplier, Factory (supply chain)
- Software, OperatingSystem, COMPATIBLE_WITH, RUNS
- Review, Sentiment, User WROTE_REVIEW, HAS_SENTIMENT
- Comparison: SIMILAR_TO, BETTER_THAN, CHEAPER_THAN
- Book: Author (nationality, biography, awards), Genre, Theme, Publisher, Series
- Genre hierarchy (SUBGENRE_OF)
- Literary connections (INSPIRED_BY, SIMILAR_THEME)
- User interactions (VIEWED, PURCHASED, ADDED_TO_WISHLIST)
- RECOMMENDED_WITH for books
- Session memory: SessionIntent, StepIntent (Explore, Decide, Execute | Research, Compare, etc.)
- 28 node labels, 22 relationship types, 50+ property keys

GAPS (not yet implemented or partial):
- Distributor node (supply chain)
- Entity resolution (merge duplicates)
- LLM-based automatic extraction from unstructured text
- create_supply_chain_relationships(): method exists but NOT called during product ingestion
- create_user_interactions(): method exists but NOT called during product ingestion (would need user event data)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCLUSION
----------
We followed MOST of the tips. The knowledge graph has:
- Detailed component nodes for laptops (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage, Display)
- Manufacturer & supply chain (Supplier, Factory)
- Software & compatibility
- Reviews & sentiment
- Comparison relationships
- Author, Genre, Theme, Publisher, Series for books
- Genre hierarchies
- Literary connections
- Rich properties throughout

Remaining opportunities: entity resolution, LLM ingestion from text, Distributor node,
and ensuring all relationship-creation methods are invoked during product ingestion.
